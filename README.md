we reconstructed and manually curated genome-scale metabolic models for the six CLas strains A4, FL17, gxpsy, Ishi-1, psy62, and YCPsy, in addition to a model of the most closely related microorganism, the culturable bacterium L. crescens BT-1. We predicted distinct nutritional requirements for each bacterium and performed experimental assays of growth phenotypes for CLas strains in hairy root-based systems and for L. crescens BT-1 in cultivation, thus determining and providing knowledge about their specific niches

Each micoorganism contains a model in different media (BM7, M13,M14, M15) and format (.json, .mat, .xml)
